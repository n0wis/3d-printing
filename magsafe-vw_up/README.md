**If you know what you're doing**, an electrical connection to a Qi charger can be established.
Check the dimensions form the STLs to determine the kind of charger you need - eBay and AliExpress have plenty of suitable options.
I won't go into the details since it might cause harm to your car and electronics but from the files it should be obvious.
Hint: it involves jump wires and some hot glue.
